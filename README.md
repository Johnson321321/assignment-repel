This will be a sketch that is more about sprite interactivity than a game.
## The Goal
Your program will feature two non-player sprites and one player sprite. The player sprite will be controlled by the mouse. When the player sprite gets close (not touching yet) the non-player sprites will move away from the player. As though they were trying to avoid it. If the player catches the sprite, the player gets a point.

You will do this in assigned groups of three. It will require you to fully understand the visual space and as such, **I will require each group to come up with a visual plan** of how they will achieve this functionality, *before* they start coding.

Some useful concepts that can help you achieve this functionality are:
- [`PVector`](https://processing.org/reference/PVector.html)
  - [`v1.add(v2)`]() - Add one vector to another (For increasing speed, applying friction, or gravity)
  - [`PVector.sub(v1, v2)`](https://processing.org/reference/PVector_sub_.html) - Get the difference between two vectors
  - [`vector.heading()`](https://processing.org/reference/PVector_heading_.html) - Gives you the angle (direction) of a vector
  - [`vector.mag()`](https://processing.org/reference/PVector_mag_.html) - Gives you the distance or magnitude of a vector
  - [`PVector.fromAngle(radians)`](https://processing.org/reference/PVector_fromAngle_.html) - Creates a new vector moving in a particular direction specified by the degree in radians parameter.
  
### Requirements:
1. Come up with a visual plan (drawing) of how you will be coding this functionality.
2. List the incremental development steps. See the [dodging-game](https://github.com/MrGallo/assignment-dodging-game) assignment instructions for an example. In your repository `Projects` section, create a project, call it "Incremental Development". Within the `Project`, add three columns, "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". Place all your incremental development steps from step #2 as single "notes" in the "To Do" column. As you begin working on a step, drag it to the "In Progress", as you complete a step, move it to "Done". Any other issues or problems, add to the "To Do" column.
3. Include the Incremental Development steps in the README.md file.
4. [Ensure PEP-8 compliance](http://pep8online.com/)
5. Include [pydoc](https://repl.it/@DanielGallo/Pydoc-Example) internal documentation and relevant comments describing sections of code.
